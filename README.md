# Neural_Network_Charity_Analysis

## Overview
The purpose of this project is to design a deep-learning neural networks using TensorFlow to create a binary classification model that can predict if an Alphabet Soupâ€“funded organization will be successful based on the features in the dataset.  

## Results

***Data Preprocessing***

I needed to preprocess the dataset in order to compile, train, and evaluate the neural network model.

- What variable(s) are considered the target(s) for your model?

- What variable(s) are considered to be the features for your model?

- What variable(s) are neither targets nor features, and should be removed from the input data?

***Compiling, Training, and Evaluating the Model***

- How many neurons, layers, and activation functions did you select for your neural network model, and why?

- Were you able to achieve the target model performance?

- What steps did you take to try and increase model performance?
